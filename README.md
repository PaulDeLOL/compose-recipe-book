Recipe Book App - Pablo Guardia
================================

Recipe Book App created for Assignment 3 of COP4656 - Mobile Programming.
The app's source code was taken from the Affirmations app codelab in the Android Basics with Compose course. Code was started from the starter branch, and once the affirmations app was complete, the images and the text were changed to show foods. A scrollable list of 10 foods should be shown upon starting the app.
